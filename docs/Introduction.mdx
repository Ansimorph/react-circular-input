# Getting Started

React components for easily composing a circular range input ðŸŒ€

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
npm install react-circular-input
```

## Importing

And import the components from the package:

```
import { Input, Progress, Thumb, Track } from 'react-circular-input'
```

Now you're ready to use the components! ðŸŽ‰

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<Input value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<Track />
				<Progress />
				<Thumb />
			</Input>
		)
	}}
</Playground>
