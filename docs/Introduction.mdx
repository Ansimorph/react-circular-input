# Getting Started

React components for easily composing a circular range input ðŸŒ€

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
npm install react-circular-input
```

## Importing

And import the components from the package:

```
import {
	CircularInput,
	CircularProgress,
	CircularThumb,
	CircularTrack
} from 'react-circular-input'
```

Now you're ready to use the components! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<CircularInput value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<CircularTrack />
				<CircularProgress />
				<CircularThumb />
			</CircularInput>
		)
	}}
</Playground>

A declarative and composable approach means we have a lot of flexibility, check out the next sections for how to go further!
