# Components

## Progress

Displays a circular segment from zero to the value provided.

If you provide `onChange` to `Input`, it will update the value to nearest point on click.

Takes same props as SVG `circle` **except for the following**:

- `cx`
- `cy`
- `r`
- `strokeDasharray`
- `strokeDashoffset`
- `transform`

These are used to support functionality.

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<Input value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<Progress />
			</Input>
		)
	}}
</Playground>

## Thumb

Displays a handle exactly at the right point in the circumference to match the value provided.

If you provide `onChange` to `Input`, it will become draggable and update the value as it's dragged.

Takes same props as SVG `circle` **except for the following**:

- `cx`
- `cy`
- `onMouseDown`
- `onTouchStart`

These are used to support functionality.

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<Input value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<Thumb />
			</Input>
		)
	}}
</Playground>

## Track

Displays the path which the `Thumb` will follow.

If you provide `onChange` to `Input`, it will update the value to nearest point on click.

Takes same props as SVG `circle` **except for the following**:

- `cx`
- `cy`
- `r`

These are used to support functionality.

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<Input value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<Track />
			</Input>
		)
	}}
</Playground>
