# Components

## CircularProgress

Displays a circular segment from zero to the value provided.

If you provide `onChange` to `CircularInput`, it will update the value to nearest point on click.

Takes same props as SVG `circle` **except for the following**:

- `cx`
- `cy`
- `r`
- `strokeDasharray`
- `strokeDashoffset`
- `transform`

These are used to support functionality.

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<CircularInput value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<CircularProgress />
			</CircularInput>
		)
	}}
</Playground>

## CircularThumb

Displays a handle exactly at the right point in the circumference to match the value provided.

If you provide `onChange` to `CircularInput`, it will become draggable and update the value as it's dragged.

Takes same props as SVG `circle` **except for the following**:

- `cx`
- `cy`
- `onMouseDown`
- `onTouchStart`

These are used to support functionality.

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<CircularInput value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<CircularThumb />
			</CircularInput>
		)
	}}
</Playground>

## CircularTrack

Displays the path which the `CircularThumb` will follow.

If you provide `onChange` to `CircularInput`, it will update the value to nearest point on click.

Takes same props as SVG `circle` **except for the following**:

- `cx`
- `cy`
- `r`

These are used to support functionality.

This component by itself is not very exciting... ðŸ˜…

		const [value, setValue] = useState(0.25)
		return (
			<CircularInput value={value} onChange={setValue}>
				<CircularTrack />
			</CircularInput>
