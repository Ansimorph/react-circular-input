# Hooks

‚ö†Ô∏è **The hooks below can only be used by children of `CircularInput`**.

Very useful for implementing your own interactive custom components! üëÜ

## useCircularDrag

Makes an element trigger the `onChange` on click and drag with the nearest value.

Adds/removes event listeners as needed so you don't have to worry about that complexity.

```jsx
const ref = useRef(null)
useCircularDrag(ref)
// ...on click/drag it's going to update value to the nearest point in the value circumference
```

## useCircularInputContext

As the names implies, gives you access to the same context used by the components so you can create custom ones. üôÇ

```jsx
const {
	value,
	radius,
	center,
	onChange,
	getPointFromValue, // returns {x,y} when given a value [0-1]
	getValueFromPointerEvent, // returns the nearest value to the given {x,y}
} = useCircularInputContext()
```
